	<h3>QUESTION NO. 6</h3>
	<div class="intro">

		CSS3 is the latest standard for the CSS language, under development since 2005. It is compatible with older version of css. Although
		it is compatibile with older version, it has significant differences. These differences can be catagorized into six. I will try to explain each of them.
		<h4>1. Mobile first mentality</h4>
		CSS3 inherently supports responsive design, and it can also handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on.
		<h4>2. Module-based code</h4>
		One big improvement of the new CSS is it is divided into modules. All of the old CSS specifications have been  brought over to new version and divided into smaller pieces. CSS3 has new modules as well.
		<h4>some new modules are:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Selectors</li>
			<li>The Box Model module</li>
			<li>Text effects</li>
			<li>Backgrounds and borders</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Web font support</h4>
		This gives designers access to way more than just “web safe” fonts.
		Before CSS3, designers could only use “web safe” fonts to be sure that the fonts would always be displayed the same on everyone’s machine. Web safe fonts are fonts that every single computer has installed and recognizes. Designers can now use special fonts like those available via Google Fonts and Typecast.
		<h4>Faster development and faster load time</h4>
		What used to require background images, CSS3 can now achieve with visual enhancements, which saves development time.This reduces load times for numerous images because these effects are all built into the code. Also, pages load faster thanks to overall smaller file sizes and fewer calls.
		<h4>New colors and image effects</h4>
		CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA, HSL, HSLA) and gradient colors, and allows for adjustments to opacity.  Another big change is its support of rounded image corners, an effect that required a lot of formatting to achieve before.
		<h4>Create 2D and 3D transformations and animations</h4>
		These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different color. This feature enables elements created in CSS move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash code.
