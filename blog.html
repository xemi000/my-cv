	<h3>USAGE OF RELATIVE SIZES IN ZOOMING ELEMENTS</h3>
	<div class="body2">
	<div class="intro">
	<p>
		Generally, using em's and percentages is the same as they are relative, rather than the definite pixel. If you set something as 4em wide then when you zoom/the text size is changed, the box stays about the same size relative to the text.
		
		But relatives units could not be expected to do all the work by web designers.In real life, you can't rely on em for your designs as soon as they involve image backgrounds, or images as main subjects.
		For example, It does not help us in image style borders.

		Nowadays major browsers know how to magnificate (differs from "zoom") a content with all its elements, even though they are defined in pixels. A full pixel design is nice too if you follow some rules for spacing elements.

	<h3>INTERPRETATION OF 16PX DEFAULT WIDTH IN 200PX SIZE</h3>
	<div class="intro">
	<p>
		px(pixel) is an absolute screen size measurment meaning the object takes 200(representing number value) amount of place(measured in px) in the screen. While if we used relative units on objects, those objects would use 16px as a defalut and change that with respect to the value we assigned to our object. For instance, 1rem=16px. And if we were to take  200 percents(%), it would translate to 32px.

		But since px is fixed, it does not fluctuate or consider relative values on an element.

	<h3>CHANGES IN THE NEW CSS</h3>
	<div class="intro">
	
	<p>
		CSS3 is the latest standard for the CSS language, under development since 2005. It is compatible with older version of css. Although
		it is compatibile with older version, it has significant differences. These differences can be catagorized into six. I will try to explain each of them.
		<h4>1. Mobile first mentality</h4>
		CSS3 inherently supports responsive design, and it can also handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on.
		<h4>2. Module-based code</h4>
		One big improvement of the new CSS is it is divided into modules. All of the old CSS specifications have been  brought over to new version and divided into smaller pieces. CSS3 has new modules as well.
		<h4>some new modules are:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Selectors</li>
			<li>The Box Model module</li>
			<li>Text effects</li>
			<li>Backgrounds and borders</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Web font support</h4>
		This gives designers access to way more than just “web safe” fonts.
		Before CSS3, designers could only use “web safe” fonts to be sure that the fonts would always be displayed the same on everyone’s machine. Web safe fonts are fonts that every single computer has installed and recognizes. Designers can now use special fonts like those available via Google Fonts and Typecast.
		<h4>Faster development and faster load time</h4>
		What used to require background images, CSS3 can now achieve with visual enhancements, which saves development time.This reduces load times for numerous images because these effects are all built into the code. Also, pages load faster thanks to overall smaller file sizes and fewer calls.
		<h4>New colors and image effects</h4>
		CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA, HSL, HSLA) and gradient colors, and allows for adjustments to opacity.  Another big change is its support of rounded image corners, an effect that required a lot of formatting to achieve before.
		<h4>Create 2D and 3D transformations and animations</h4>
		These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different color. This feature enables elements created in CSS move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash code.
